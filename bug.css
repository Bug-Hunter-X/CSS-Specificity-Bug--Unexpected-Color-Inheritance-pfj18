The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpected */
}
```

The issue arises because the `div p` selector is more specific than the `div` selector.  While it might seem intuitive that the `div` selector should apply its `color: blue;` to the `p` element *inside* the `div`, the more specific selector wins, resulting in green text.  This is a subtle bug that developers might miss if they aren't meticulously reviewing specificity rules.
